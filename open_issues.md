# Open Issues — Parameter Defaults

This register catalogs frozen-pack parameters that still require alignment across architecture, RTL, and verification teams.
Populate each section with the agreed rationale, vetted proposals, and final decision log once available.

## DELTA_THRESH

### Rationale
_TODO: Explain the control objective and constraints driving the DELTA_THRESH selection (e.g., sensitivity vs. stability)._ 

### Proposed Values
- _TBD — list candidate thresholds and the owning workstream._

### Decision History
| Date | Change | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _TBD_ | _Pending_ | _No decision recorded yet._ |

## K_MAX

### Rationale
_TODO: Summarize workload coverage, hardware limits, and verification concerns that inform the maximum K bound._

### Proposed Values
- _TBD — enumerate proposed maxima and associated analysis._

### Decision History
| Date | Change | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _TBD_ | _Pending_ | _Awaiting architecture sign-off._ |

## Additional Parameters

Introduce future unresolved parameters using the structure below:

### PARAM_NAME

#### Rationale
_TODO: Capture the design or verification motivations for this parameter._

#### Proposed Values
- _TBD — add candidate settings with owners and references._

#### Decision History
| Date | Change | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _TBD_ | _Pending_ | _Update once a decision is ratified._ |
