# Open Issues — Parameter Defaults

This register catalogs frozen-pack parameters that still require alignment across architecture, RTL, and verification teams. Track the rationale, vetted proposals, and the final decision log for each entry until it is closed.

## DELTA_THRESH

### Rationale
_TBD — describe the control objective, sensitivity analysis, and stability constraints informing the DELTA_THRESH selection._

### Proposed Values
| Candidate | Owner | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _TBD_ | _Pending_ | _Capture modeling data, silicon feedback, or verification coverage impacts._ |

### Decision History
| Date | Decision | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _TBD_ | _Pending_ | _No decision recorded yet._ |

## K_MAX

### Rationale
_TBD — summarize workload coverage, hardware limits, and verification concerns that bound K_MAX._

### Proposed Values
| Candidate | Owner | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _TBD_ | _Pending_ | _Document architectural recommendations or experiments._ |

### Decision History
| Date | Decision | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _TBD_ | _Pending_ | _Awaiting architecture sign-off._ |

## Additional Parameters

Introduce future unresolved parameters using the template below. Duplicate the block and replace `PARAM_NAME` with the parameter under review.

### PARAM_NAME

#### Rationale
_TBD — capture the design, modeling, or verification motivations for this parameter._

#### Proposed Values
| Candidate | Owner | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _TBD_ | _Pending_ | _Add candidate settings with owners and references._ |

#### Decision History
| Date | Decision | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _TBD_ | _Pending_ | _Update once a decision is ratified._ |
